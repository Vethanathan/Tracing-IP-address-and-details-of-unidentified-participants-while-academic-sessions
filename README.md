# Tracing-IP-address-and-details-of-unidentified-participants-while-academic-sessions.

The links for academic sessions/webinars/CREs are shared by few students to miscreants, who then login into the meeting/sessions using the same link by using IDâ€™s or names of other identified participants. After login into the meeting, miscreant/mischievous students creates indiscipline, confusion and use foul abusive languages to disturb the whole meeting.Summary: Covid Pandemic /Lockdown has resulted in frustrations among students,It has affected their mental health as well, resulting in unwanted behaviours and activities which disturbs the whole class, and the decorum of the session/academic activities

Objective: 1. Solutions need to be devised so that the intruders/miscreants are identified. 2. They should not be able to use IDs and Names of the identified Participants/Students . 3. It should get easy for the Host to block such intruders which does not happen usually. 4. Messages (which are usually disturbing and offensive) need to be blocked in such a way that they are not shown in the chat box or displayed during the session."
